# Welcome to the Crescendle frontend!

This app is built using React on the frontend and Ruby on Rails on the backend. It allows users to test their musical skills by solving daily melody puzzles using an on-screen piano and sheet music. The melodies are two measures, and the goal is to write the sheet music while listening to the target melody as few times as possible. Each submition will give you a percentage score based on how accurate your guess was to the target melody.

While user statistics will persist without creating an account, to access extra features users can safely sign up and log in. Password encryption is done with bcrypt.

The app utilizes the abcjs library to display musical notation and the React Piano library to provide a virtual piano for the user to play on.

In addition to the daily puzzle feature, the app also provides a practice section where users can hone their skills by playing scales and identifying musical intervals. Choose from a list of major scales, or train your ear by listening to randomly generated intervals and built up a streak by guessing multiple in a row. This is great for beginner and intermediate musicians.

Users can track their personal progress and view overall statistics for the app. If you have existing statistics, and decide to create an account, the existing stats will be automatically transferred to your new account. 

I hope you enjoy using the Crescendle and that it helps you improve in your musical endeavors!
